## Overview

Download annual and periodic reports for China A-share and Hong Kong stocks from cninfo.com.cn and upload them to NotebookLM for AI-powered analysis with a specialized "Financial Analyst" persona.

## Script Responsibilities

| Script | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| `download.py` | Download reports from cninfo.com.cn |
| `upload.py` | Upload PDFs to NotebookLM |
| `run.py` | Orchestrate: download → create notebook → upload → cleanup |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 0: Environment Setup (First Run Only)

**Crucial**: Before running the script, verify the environment is ready.

1. **Check Dependencies**: Verify if the dependencies are installed (specifically `notebooklm` and `playwright`).
2. **Install**: If dependencies are missing or this is the first run, execute the installation script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Authenticate**: Ensure the user has authenticated with NotebookLM (`notebooklm login`). If not, ask them to do so.

### Step 1: Run Main Orchestration Script

Run the script from the skill directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/run.py <stock_code_or_name>
```

Examples:

- `python3 scripts/run.py 600350` - A-share stock
- `python3 scripts/run.py 山东高速` - A-share by name
- `python3 scripts/run.py 00700` - Hong Kong stock (Tencent)
- `python3 scripts/run.py 腾讯控股` - Hong Kong by name

This script handles everything:

1. Downloads reports to a temp directory (last 10 years annual + current periodic).
2. Creates a NotebookLM notebook.
3. Configures the notebook with `assets/financial_analyst_prompt.txt`.
4. Uploads all PDFs.
5. Cleans up temp files.

### Step 2: Report to User

Provide:

- ✅ Number of reports downloaded & uploaded
- 📚 NotebookLM notebook ID
- 📊 Market type (A-share or Hong Kong)
- 💡 Remind user the notebook creates a "Financial Analyst" persona for deep analysis.

## Configuration

The skill uses a custom system prompt located at:
`assets/financial_analyst_prompt.txt`

This prompt configures NotebookLM to act as a "Financial Report Analyst" based on "Hand-holding Financial Reporting" methodology.

## Error Handling

| Error | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Stock not found | Check if code is valid A-share or Hong Kong stock |
| NotebookLM CLI not found | Ensure `notebooklm-py` matches `requirements.txt` and is in PATH |
| Auth missing | Run `notebooklm login` to authenticate via browser |
| Upload failed | Check network connection and NotebookLM service status |

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- `httpx` package
- `notebooklm-py` package
- `playwright` (for authentication)

## Quick Reference

### A-share Report Types

| Report Type | Category Code | Period |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Annual | `category_ndbg_szsh` | Previous 10 years |
| Semi-Annual | `category_bndbg_szsh` | Current year |
| Q1 Report | `category_yjdbg_szsh` | Current year |
| Q3 Report | `category_sjdbg_szsh` | Current year |

### Hong Kong Stock Differences

| Aspect | A-share | Hong Kong |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Market code | `szse`/`sse` | `hke` |
| API Method | Category-based filtering | Keyword search API |
| Search key | Uses category codes | Uses stock code + "年报" search |
| Report naming | `YYYY年年度报告` | `年报`, `年度报告`, `财务年度报告` |
| Data availability | Full history | May have limited history |

### Hong Kong Stock API Details

Hong Kong stocks use a different API approach:

1. **Search URL**: `https://www.cninfo.com.cn/new/commonUrl?url=disclosure/list/notice#hke%2F1_hkeMain`
2. **Search Method**: Keyword search with stock code (e.g., "00700 年报")
3. **Report Patterns**: 
   - 年报 (e.g., "2024 年报")
   - 财务年度报告 (e.g., "2024财务年度报告" - used by Alibaba)
   - 年度报告 (e.g., "2024年度报告")

**Note**: Some Hong Kong stocks may have limited historical data on cninfo.com.cn, especially those that listed recently.
